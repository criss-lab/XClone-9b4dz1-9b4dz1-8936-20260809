# Testagram Virtual CDN

## Zero-cost mode

The active IPTV delivery path is **origin-first**. XClone requests each channel's original URL directly. For browsers using hls.js, `src/services/virtualCdnLoader.ts` adds a browser-side virtual cache for eligible HLS media fragments:

- Cache Storage entries are scoped to the XClone browser origin/profile and can be reused by tabs on that origin.
- Concurrent fragment requests within a page are coalesced.
- Live segment entries expire after 20 seconds and the cache is capped at 180 segment keys.
- Manifests, encryption keys, byte-range requests, and URLs with token/signature/auth query parameters are not cached or shared.
- Cache, CORS, quota, private-browsing, and peer-transport failures must not block direct-origin playback.

## Cross-device peer delivery

Eligible public HLS fragments can be exchanged across viewer devices over WebRTC data channels. The existing Supabase Realtime client is used only for signaling; video bytes do not pass through Supabase. The implementation currently:

- Randomly shards viewers into 65,536 signaling cohorts per stream to reduce broadcast fan-out at larger audience sizes.
- Peer sharing is opt-in because direct WebRTC connections can reveal network/IP metadata to connected peers and consume upload data; the UI explains this before/while enabling it.
- Limits each browser to three peer connections, one active upload per peer, and segments of at most 1.5 MB.
- Waits for two distinct peers that have each fetched the segment directly from the source; both transferred payloads must match SHA-256 before peer bytes are used.
- Serves only source-fetched cache entries onward. Peer-derived cache entries are never re-shared, preventing one bad peer from propagating its payload through the mesh.
- Uses a short peer wait timeout and falls back to the original stream when peers are unavailable, hashes disagree, CORS prevents caching, or WebRTC cannot establish a direct path.
- Skips signed/tokenized URLs and authenticated requests rather than sharing private media.

**Integrity limitation:** matching hashes from two peers detects accidental corruption and a single inconsistent peer, but it is not a cryptographic proof that media matches the origin because most public HLS sources do not publish signed segment hashes. Only use this mode for public streams where peer-assisted delivery is acceptable. A future source-signed hash contract would provide stronger authenticity.

**Scaling limitation:** cohort sharding bounds per-room signaling fan-out, but does not make Supabase Realtime unlimited. A million-viewer service cannot be promised on a free tier; actual capacity depends on concurrent Realtime connections, browser support, NAT topology, available peers, source bandwidth, and provider limits. This mode does not require a paid CDN or hosted media edge, but the origin remains the fallback and can still carry substantial traffic.

## Hosted Go edge

The Go edge implementation in this directory is retained for source-level regression tests and possible future use, but the production deployment workflow and Compose service are disabled in virtual-CDN mode. Do not configure `media.testagram.site` as a required playback endpoint. IPTV playback must remain functional without this service.

## Verification

From the repository root:

```sh
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run validate:seo
cd services/testagram-cdn
go test ./...
go test -race ./...
go vet ./...
go build ./cmd/...
```

The Go checks validate retained code only; they do not deploy or claim a running CDN.


## Capacity planning for very large audiences

The client uses 65,536 randomized signaling cohorts to keep presence lists smaller and jitters peer connection creation to reduce join storms. These are **client-side fan-out controls, not a million-viewer capacity guarantee**.

At 1,000,000 concurrently watching browsers, the current topology still needs approximately 1,000,000 live Supabase Realtime client connections (typically one active signaling channel per active stream room per browser), plus WebRTC peer connections. Cohorting does not reduce the number of connected clients. A free/shared Realtime project cannot be assumed to admit or sustain that load, and the browser mesh cannot help users until signaling introduces them to peers.

Before advertising or enabling a million-viewer event, load-test the actual Supabase project and real devices, and record concurrent connections, join/leave churn, signaling messages/sec, WebRTC establishment success, peer-cache hit rate, origin bytes/sec, and playback stalls. If the existing project cannot support the required signaling connection count, the constraints "no additional hosting/service" and "one million simultaneous viewers" conflict: a horizontally scalable signaling tier or a provider plan with verified capacity is required. This repository deliberately does not fake that missing capacity or silently route media through a paid edge.


## Runtime capacity telemetry

The browser now exposes aggregate, in-memory counters through
`getVirtualCdnMetrics()` in `src/services/virtualCdnMetrics.ts` and dispatches
`testagram-vcdn-metric` events. The counters include cache hits/misses, origin
fetches and bytes, peer requests/hits/bytes, signaling failures, connection
success/failure, integrity failures, transfer timeouts, and playback stalls.
Events deliberately omit stream URLs, peer IDs, IP addresses, credentials, and
account identifiers. A host integration can forward aggregate counts to an
approved telemetry backend; the current implementation does not upload metrics
automatically, so these counters alone are not centralized production monitoring. The
client-local `clientOffloadByteShare` includes browser-cache and peer-delivered bytes;
it is diagnostic only and must not be treated as a fleet-wide offload measurement.

Peer transfer now rejects oversized binary frames and stops enqueueing data when
the channel remains congested after a short backpressure wait. Transient WebRTC
`disconnected` states are not immediately torn down because they can recover;
`failed` and `closed` connections are still cleaned up. This improves resource
safety but does not remove the external signaling connection ceiling.


## Two-million-viewer capacity target (not yet validated)

The engineering target can be raised to **2,000,000 concurrent viewers**, but changing
a constant or cohort count does not create capacity. At this audience size, the
system must explicitly measure and budget:

- **Signaling connections:** with the current client-side Supabase Realtime topology,
  opted-in active browsers still need live signaling connections. At 2 million active
  viewers and 100% peer-sharing opt-in, the rough floor is 2 million concurrent
  signaling connections if each viewer uses one room/channel. This is not a claim
  that Supabase supports that count.
- **Origin bandwidth:** total unassisted media bandwidth is approximately viewer
  count multiplied by average media bitrate. Only measured peer offload can reduce
  the expected origin share; never assume an offload percentage in production.
- **Peer mesh health:** measure join/leave churn, offer/answer and ICE success,
  peer hit rate, bytes served/received, upload fairness, integrity rejects, and
  stalls by geography and network class.
- **Regional resilience:** test cross-region latency, NAT/firewall failure, peers
  with limited upload, popular-channel hotspots, signaling reconnect storms, and
  origin-only fallback during a peer-network outage.
- **Privacy and consent:** peer sharing remains opt-in. Data-saver/cellular users
  must not be forced into upload; signed or authenticated media must not be shared.

A pure browser mesh is not a guarantee of global CDN availability. Browser peers
are intermittent, can be behind restrictive NAT, and have asymmetric upload. Keep
origin playback available and capacity-plan for a large peer-offline population.
The free-only constraint may be incompatible with two million simultaneous users
if existing signaling or origin infrastructure has insufficient verified capacity.
Do not advertise the target as achieved until a staged load test and production
telemetry prove it.

The pure helper `src/services/virtualCdnCapacity.ts` calculates a transparent
planning estimate for signaling connection count and origin bandwidth from explicit
inputs. Its peer-offload input must come from measured telemetry, not a guess. The
integration workflow runs executable Node tests for baseline 2M math, explicit
measured-offload math, zero viewers, and non-finite input handling. These are model
unit tests, not a network/load test and not proof of live provider capacity.


## Staged load and fallback verification

Run `node scripts/virtual-cdn-staged-load.mjs` from the repository root. The
loopback-only harness stages 100, 500, and 1,000 simulated viewers, in both
peer-available and forced-peer/signaling-outage modes. It records request rate,
origin bytes and request count, peak in-flight origin requests, worker concurrency,
RSS before/after, failures, and whether all media requests recover through origin
fallback. The origin is a local mock server bound only to `127.0.0.1`; the test
does not contact production endpoints or Supabase.

This simulation validates the harness's bounded-work and fallback assumptions. It
does not instantiate the production browser WebRTC mesh, does not exercise actual
Supabase Realtime connection limits, and does not prove production origin capacity.
The configured origin capacity and peer hit rate are test inputs, not measurements.
A separate approved, isolated environment is required for real service load tests.
