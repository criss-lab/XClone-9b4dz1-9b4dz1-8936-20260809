## What is Testagram?

Testagram is a responsive social ecosystem built around user publishing and discovery. It brings together social posts and threads, short-form video, communities, live experiences, creator tools, monetization, wallet/payment flows, commerce, Fediverse discovery, publisher/RSS content, and an in-product Help Center.

The repository is a React + TypeScript application using Vite, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, serverless integrations, and route-level lazy loading. Production changes are validated through automated quality and deployment workflows.

## Product capabilities

### Social publishing
- Posts, threads, replies, quote posts, reposts, likes, bookmarks, polls, hashtags, mentions, and post history.
- Multi-image posts and video publishing.
- Dedicated profile surfaces for posts, threads, replies, media, videos, likes, followers, and following.
- Lists, history, notifications, direct messages, search, and discovery.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Use a current Node.js LTS release and npm compatible with the repository lockfile.

Install dependencies:

~~~bash
npm ci
~~~

Start development:

~~~bash
npm run dev
~~~

Run TypeScript validation:

~~~bash
npm run typecheck
~~~

Run lint:

~~~bash
npm run lint
~~~

Build for production:

~~~bash
npm run build
~~~

Preview the production build:

~~~bash
npm run preview
~~~

## Environment configuration

The browser-facing example configuration is provided in .env.example.

Typical client configuration:

~~~env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
VITE_POSTHOG_KEY=
VITE_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
~~~

A legacy VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY variable may be supported during migration where documented by the application.

**Never put service-role keys, payment secrets, private API credentials, or other privileged secrets into Vite client-side variables.**

## Backend and data

Supabase provides the primary backend services:

- PostgreSQL database
- Authentication
- Row Level Security
- Storage
- Realtime subscriptions
- Edge Functions

Database changes should use migrations and be reviewed for authorization, ownership, indexes, performance, backward compatibility, and data retention.

Privileged operations belong on trusted server-side infrastructure.

## Production engineering standards

### Performance
- Lazy load route-level pages.
- Load secondary datasets only when they are needed.
- Use cursor-based pagination for long feeds.
- Cache short-lived external feed requests.
- Optimize images and media delivery.
- Avoid permanently storing transient live-stream media unless recording is explicitly required.

### Reliability
- Treat optional integrations as independently failure-prone.
- Provide explicit loading, empty, success, and error states.
- Do not turn backend failures into success-looking UI.
- Retry safe transient operations.
- Verify the exact commit SHA throughout CI and deployment.
- Treat CI success and production deployment success as separate checks.

### Security
- Enforce authorization server-side and with RLS.
- Validate untrusted input at trust boundaries.
- Keep privileged credentials server-side.
- Treat RSS, Fediverse, uploaded, and user-generated content as untrusted.
- Safely handle external URLs and media.
- Protect payment, moderation, administration, and account operations with appropriate authorization.

### UX and accessibility
- Mobile-first responsive design.
- Keyboard/focus support and accessible labels.
- Consistent touch targets and interactive states.
- Clear destructive-action confirmation.
- Useful loading, empty, and error states.
- Internal product navigation stays inside Testagram wherever possible.

## Quality gates and deployment

Local validation:

~~~bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
~~~

Production readiness requires more than a local build. Verify:

1. The intended commit SHA is being tested.
2. Typecheck passes.
3. Lint passes.
4. The production build passes.
5. Relevant contract/quality workflows pass.
6. Deployment reconciliation completes.
7. The deployed application corresponds to the intended revision.
8. A browser smoke test covers affected critical routes.
9. Runtime console and chunk-loading errors are absent on affected flows.

GitHub Actions in this repository provide automated quality and operational gates. Deployment status should always be checked against the exact revision being released.

## Data and content boundaries

Testagram may display content from several sources: Testagram users, communities, federated services, and external publishers.

These sources have different ownership and trust boundaries. External publisher and federated material should remain clearly attributable to its origin and must not be represented as original Testagram-authored content.

Live media has a different lifecycle from uploaded media: a broadcaster can provide content while online, while transient live content should not automatically become permanent backend storage.

## Help and support

The in-product Help Center is available at:

/help

It provides:
- Searchable help articles
- Article feedback
- Video-guide entry points
- Support request submission
- Authenticated support-ticket history
- AI-assisted support
- Links to privacy, terms, and community-policy resources

## Development workflow

1. Reproduce the issue or define the intended behavior.
2. Inspect the relevant route, component, service, database contract, and workflow.
3. Fix the underlying cause rather than masking symptoms.
4. Check for stale imports, dead UI, duplicate logic, broken navigation, and inconsistent states.
5. Run typecheck, lint, and production build.
6. Inspect CI against the exact commit SHA.
7. Verify deployment status and revision lineage.
8. Browser-test the affected user journey.
9. Document meaningful architectural or operational changes.

## Product direction

Current engineering priorities include:

- Incremental and fast feed loading.
- Reliable RSS/publisher and Fediverse ingestion.
- Efficient live audio/video experiences.
- Creator and monetization workflows.
- Wallet, payment, and commerce reliability.
- Strong privacy, safety, moderation, and support tooling.
- Production-grade CI/CD and deployment verification.
- Reducing unnecessary backend storage and external-service cost.
- Maintaining a coherent UX as the product surface expands.

## Contributing

Before submitting changes:

- Keep TypeScript clean and avoid unnecessary any types.
- Reuse shared components and hooks.
- Follow established Tailwind and UI conventions.
- Keep route components lazy-loadable where appropriate.
- Add loading, error, and empty states.
- Never introduce client-side secrets.
- Test affected flows on mobile and desktop.
- Check the exact Git commit and deployment generated by the change.
